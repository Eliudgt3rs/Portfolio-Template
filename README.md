## ✏️ How to Edit Your Website

### 📝 Change Text

1. In the left sidebar, click on `index.html`
2. Look for lines like:

```html
<h1>Hello, I'm Jane Doe</h1>
<p>I’m a web developer based in Nairobi.</p>
Change the text between the tags <h1>, <p>, etc., to your own name, bio, etc.

🖼️ Change Images
Go to the images folder in the sidebar

Right-click on the existing image (like profile.jpg) and click Delete

Right-click the images folder and choose Upload to upload your own image

In index.html, update the image name if needed:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="images/your-image.jpg" alt="My Photo">
✅ Make sure the name matches exactly, including .jpg or .png.

🧷 How to Change the Favicon (The Website Tab Icon)
The favicon is the small icon you see on the browser tab next to the page title — usually a logo or symbol.

Here’s how to change it to your own icon using Icons8:

🖼️ 1. Download a New Icon
Go to https://icons8.com/icons

Search for an icon you like (e.g. camera, code, briefcase, etc.)

Click on the icon you want

Choose PNG format, size 32x32 or 64x64

Click Download

✅ A .png file will be saved to your computer — for example: favicon.png

📁 2. Add the New Favicon to Your Website
Open the project folder in https://vscode.dev

Right-click inside the main project folder (the one that contains index.html)

Choose Upload and select your downloaded favicon.png

✅ The file should now appear in the root folder (same level as index.html).

🧼 3. Remove the Old Favicon
Look for a file like favicon.ico or old-favicon.png in the project folder.

Right-click it

Choose Delete



🎨 Change Colors, Fonts, and Layout
Click on style.css in the sidebar

You’ll see things like:

css
Copy
Edit
body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: #333333;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
You can:

Change background-color to something like #f5f5f5 or lightblue

Change the font-family if you want a different look

Play around — don’t worry, you can’t break anything!

💡 Try https://coolors.co to pick your favorite colors.
